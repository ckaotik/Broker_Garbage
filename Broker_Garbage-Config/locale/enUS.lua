Don't forget to use the default lists! They provide a great example.
First, put any items you don't want to lose on your |cffffd200Keep List|r. Make good use of categories (see below)! If the LootManager is active it will by default alwas try to loot these items (changable in LM settings).
|cffAAAAAAe.g. class reagents, flasks|r
Items which may be thrown away any time belong on the |cffffd200Junk List|r.
|cffAAAAAAe.g. summoned food & drink, argent lance|r
In case you encounter highly overvalued items, put them on your |cffffd200Fixed Price List|r. They will only have their vendor value used instead of auction or disenchant values. Alternatively, you can set a custom price by using |TInterface\Icons\INV_Misc_Coin_02:18|t.
|cffAAAAAAe.g. fish oil (vendor price), Broiled Dragon Feast (custom price of e.g. 20g)|r

|cffffd200Use actual values|r: This setting changes the behavior of the Junk List.

Items on your Junk List may also have a |cffffd200limit|r. This will be shown as a small number in the lower right corner. By using the |cffffd200mousewheel|r on this button you can change this number. For categories, the number of all corresponding items will be added up.
