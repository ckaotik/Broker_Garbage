Don't forget to use the default lists! They provide a great example.
First, put any items you don't want to lose on your |cffffd200Keep List|r. Make good use of categories (see below)! If the LootManager is active it will by default alwas try to loot these items (changable in LM settings).
|cffAAAAAAe.g. class reagents, flasks|r
Items which may be thrown away any time belong on the |cffffd200Junk List|r.
|cffAAAAAAe.g. summoned food & drink, argent lance|r
In case you encounter highly overvalued items, put them on your |cffffd200Fixed Price List|r. They will only have their vendor value used instead of auction or disenchant values. Alternatively, you can set a custom price by using |TInterface\Icons\INV_Misc_Coin_02:18|t.
|cffAAAAAAe.g. fish oil (vendor price), Broiled Dragon Feast (custom price of e.g. 20g)|r
Put items on your |cffffd200Sell List|r that should be sold when visiting a merchant.
|cffAAAAAAe.g. water as a warrior, cheese|r]],

|cffffd200Sell Junk List items|r: This setting is useful for those who do not want to distinguish between the Sell List and the Junk List. If you check this, any items on your Junk -or- Sell List will be sold when you visit a vendor.
|cffffd200Use actual values|r: This setting changes the behavior of the Junk List. By default (disabled) Junk List items will get their value set to 0c (statistics will still work just fine!) and they will be shown first in the tooltip.

In the top left of each button you'll see a "G" (or not). If it's there, the item is on your |cffffd200global list|r meaning this rule is effective for every character.
Items on your Junk List may also have a |cffffd200limit|r. This will be shown as a small number in the lower right corner. By using the |cffffd200mousewheel|r on this button you can change this number. For categories, the number of all corresponding items will be added up.
